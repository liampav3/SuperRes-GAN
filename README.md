## Super-Resolution Gan
#### Implementation by Liam Pavlovic

###
This project implements a generative adversarial network for the single-image super-resolution task. The implementation is based on the Super-Resolution GAN (SR-GAN) [1] and Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN (ESR-GAN) [2] papers. 

### Instructions
I recommend running the demo notebook with Google Colab. Select File > Open Notebook > GitHub and then search for this repo.
